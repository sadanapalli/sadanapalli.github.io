<blockquote><p>NOTE: A Master-level exam for AWS Certified Solutions Architect is on the roadmap</p></blockquote>

<p>AWS continues to be the leader in Public Cloud Computing Services market and AWS certifications are widely recognized in the industry. In order to learn the nitty-gritties of all AWS services, I had decided to take the AWS certification exams.</p>

<p>Being already a Senior Solutions Architect, I wanted to attempt the &ldquo;AWS Certified Solutions Architect &ndash; Associate&rdquo; exam first and gave myself 3-weeks to prepare for it. The AWS Certified Solutions Architect â€“ Associate exam is intended for individuals with experience designing distributed applications and systems on the AWS platform.</p>

<p>I have taken the exam on 06/15/2015 and passed with 85%. I honestly felt 3-weeks was not quite enough time to deep dive into all the topics the way I wanted. I found the exam to be very challenging as the exam had mostly all scenario-based questions which tested one&rsquo;s comprehensive knowledge to configure various AWS services to be able to solve different usecases.</p>

<p>What I liked the most about this exam is that it was not like read &amp; memorize some documentation and answer straight-forward questions. Hands-on experience and exposure to almost all of the AWS services are required to be able to face this exam. That &rsquo;s what makes AWS exams challenging and hence desirable to have on one&rsquo;s resume.</p>

<p>Below are some key things to know and practice until comfortable before sitting for the exam.</p>

<ol>
<li>Configuring a custom VPC and troubleshooting along with Security in VPC</li>
<li>Pay lot of attention to all aspects VPC..very important</li>
<li>Private vs Public Subnets, Security Groups vs Network ACLs, NAT instances, Internet Gateway, Storage Gateway, Virtual Private Gateway, Endpoint for S3, Life-cycle policies and Glacier</li>
<li>Elastic Load Balancer in combination with Auto-scaling</li>
<li>Different storage options, S3 vs EBS vs Ephemeral, Securing S3 buckets/objects for different scenarios, Encryption, Performance/Durability/Availability</li>
<li>Read thoroughly on &ldquo;Route 53&rdquo;, I had lot of questions on this</li>
<li>Different EC2 instance types, EBS Volumes and Snapshots, Some soft limits, Bootstrap scripts, Instance meta data,  placement groups, IP Addresses &amp; ENIs, AMIs, Optimizing I/O performance, Security</li>
<li>Configuration of Cloud Front</li>
<li>RDS/DynamoDB/RedShift</li>
<li>Basics of SWF, SQS, SNS, Cloud Watch, CloudFormation</li>
<li>IAM Users/Groups/Roles, Groups vs Roles, Policies, Service-based Roles, AD Intagration, Security</li>

</ol>


<p>Below are few points that will help towards preparation for the exam.</p>

</ol>
